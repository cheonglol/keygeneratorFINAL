Mobike software keygen

# Brief Description
Orginal tester software required a license to use full features of the tester. Using dnSpy i decopiled the .net software and reused the codes that were used to generate the password.

2024 edit:

Bikesharing is such a crazy business (clarify with me if i meant good or bad)

Whatever, I used DnSpy to decompile mobike's internal debugging tool for the physical IoT locks (which sgbike bought over (they're both out of singapore/business, so i leak now)).

Why? to find out what was the algorithm that made each key to different machine unique.
Why? because sgbikes only got 2 or 3 laptops from their acquisition and each came with the unlocked mobike debugging tool installed.
What does this mean? this meant that you can just copy-&-paste mindlessly that dumbahh debugging tool since each has a unique password

if i can recall, it has something to do with the machine's serial number and disk/drive serial too? i don't know, its been quite some time.
